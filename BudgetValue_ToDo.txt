BudgetValue
	Import History
		Security
		Be able to import from blank table
	PaycheckPlan-DistributeBalance
TM_Log
	Sometimes TM_Log has a permission error and nothing from the 2nd process writes to log.
		1) set log in _Logger
		2) Open log during tests
		3) Open log in program the tests are testing
		4) both opens write to same log
Spendables History
	What should I name these things?
		PaycheckHistory column
		Spendables column
	What should the model have?
		The Spendables column should be calculatable
		The PaycheckHistory columns must be saved
	Test
		Add and view a PaycheckHistory column
Spendables
	SpendablesPopup
		What to do when it's empty
BV redo tabs
	Split Paycheck Into Categories
	Spend From Categories
	Net Worth
	Budgeted Spendables
Spendables
	NetWoth needs to update when you change it in the other tab
		Retrieve NetWorth on switch to tab, not init
Tabs
	Split Money into categories
	Spend from categories
Simple Concept
	Split Paycheck into categories
	Split NetWorth into categories
	Spend from those categories
View
	On init, open whatever tab was last open
	MakeEntry and MakeHeader defaults
		possible name: widget factory
PaycheckPlan
	Rename to Split Paycheck Plan or something
		Split Paycheck Plan leads the understanding down the wrong path at first
		Split Paycheck is not exactly correct, but might be good
		Split Paycheck (Plan) is weird for a title
		Paycheck Split Plan might be good, but sounds awkward
Spendables
	Simplify
		Restructure PaycheckHistory
		Make categories able to be compared without comparing names, or make that default
